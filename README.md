# imdb-clone-app

A very good morning to you.
I hope you are doing well.

I am Sumanto Banerjee, from Batch – November 2021.
I’d like to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to work on this project and make this a part of my portfolio.

I learnt a considerable amount while working on this project. 
I tried to deliver to the best of my acquired knowledge. However, I feel that there are some more features that I can add or develop this app to a fully functional level as I learn further.

The project was to create a mini imDb clone app with only vanilla javascript and no libraries or frameworks.

The project requires us to build three pages namely, Home Page, Movie Page and My Favourite Movie page with different specifications.

The two major challenges that I faced during the completion of the project was:
- Firstly, how to create the search list.
- Second, how to access the movies which were created dynamically and how to perform operations on them.

So, let’s start with the index.html file wherein I tried to keep the code to minimal. Only the outline of the app has been created.
Let’s move on to the css file wherein I have tried to categorise it for readability and understandability purposes. The general css is followed by typography, which is then followed by buttons, icons, and then the body of the application. If you see in the Home page section, I have tried to club classes with same css to keep the code DRY.
Let’s shift our focus to Javascript now, wherein I have assigned variables at the very beginning, which is followed by initialising of the arrays. 
Separate functions have been created for loading movies, finding movies, displaying movies and so on. 
I have tried not to let any function do multiple tasks unless necessary.

I hope you appreciate my work as the second project and I hope that I shall be able to work and synthesize far complex projects in days to come.
